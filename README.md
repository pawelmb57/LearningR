# LearningR

These exercises were created in coordination with the book "R for Marketing Research and Analytics" by Elea Feit and Chris Chapman.  I created these exercises for an independent study with Dr. Feit at Drexel University.

The intended target market of these exercises is someone who has a basic understanding of programming and statistics.  The material does not cover the concepts thoroughly so further learning is recommended.  Although, Google can be an efficient resource. 

Keeping in mind that the exercises were created for specific functions, I welcome any comments or suggestions.
