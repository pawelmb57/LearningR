# LearningR

These exercises were created in coordination with the book "R for Marketing Research and Analytics" by Elea Feit and Chris Chapman.  I created these exercises for an independent study with Dr. Feit at Drexel University.  The topics cover in each markdown follow the respective chapters.  The reason I was keen on posting these is because with relatively little knowledge of programming you can access tremendously power techniques in R.  I hope that anyone who stumbles upon these exercises can benefit from seeing R in action.  

Please feel free to shoot over any comments or suggestions to improve these exercises!
